3. Defined the color theme using **CSS variables**, allowing an organized and scalable palette.  
4. Built the layout using **Flexbox** to center and align all elements.  
5. Styled interactive elements with **hover effects** for better user experience.  
6. Made the design responsive using **media queries** to adapt to smaller screens.
